# Create an WEBXR Augmented reality app with hitscanning and custom animated models
Hello, I'm an IT student from 'HOWEST'. My assignment was to create a 'website which can show animated models in augmented reality (AR)'. 
There are a lot of examples on animated models in regular 3d environments but a suprising lack of examples on animated models in an AR environment. 


That's why I decided to share my project. I hope that I can help people with the same problems I experienced myself.

## Info

You can use both .gltf and .glb 3d model files in this project.

I got the model in this project from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/feed).

Feel free to comment if there is something i need to know. I'm open for corrections. Thank you.
